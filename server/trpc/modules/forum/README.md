# TODOs

## Forum post reaction

The code is kind of duct taped, should be cleaner... ish 

Also need to solve the timezone issue (i.e. time comparison on server should be standarized to tz)

## Forum post attachments

Should only allow presigned url creation when a forum post exists? If not seems easily abusable if people can keep uploading files without an existing forum post. 

Need some way to check.

Also should standardize upload RPC.

Also should standardize to all CUID IDs in DB.
